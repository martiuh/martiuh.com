            I've been developing and doing things on the web since 2015, where I
            started building small PHP (incluiding one Telegram Bot), after that
            I moved tried to learn Ruby on Rails but I found it too hard and
            started learning some client side JavaScript.

          <Paragraph>
            I continued doing tutorials and small projects with React, then I
            moved into the backend with Express and continued building stuff. My
            real first project was hidroval.com.mx (listed bellow) where I made
            both backend and frontend from scratch, it took me about a year to
            finish because I rewrite the app 3 times. But eventually it helped
            me to land my first job in tech.
