### **What I learned**

- To think in a mobile first web view and a different nav for mobile.
- To customize an `.htacces` file to handle things like cache for different assets (cached forever since the filenames are hashed).
- Also redirect to an https URL in the same `.htaccess`.
- How to use `.scss`.
- Gatsby and also the API of most static site generators.
- To host a Gatsby site in a shared hosting account.

### **What it does**

- It's a website for my father's bussiness a junkyard(?).
- It allows the user to call straight from the website (I was really excited about this)
