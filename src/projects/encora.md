### **What I'm learning**

- Create enterprise level software from scratch
- Better team management
- Work with Typescript and Nest.JS

### **Talent Platform**

Me and other developers started working in an app to manage all the talent within the organization, I worked on the backend built with Nest.js and also as the tech lead I procure others to write tests for each feature or bugfix they were making in order to have a maintainable project.

### **The Bouqs(August 2020 - present)**

I work for [The Bouqs](https://bouqs.com) as a Encora employee. I'm handling some fullstack JavaScript and working on some new projects with Next.js. It's my first time working in an e-commerce app and it's really exciting for me since every thing I do needs to be careful since a mistake could mean loosing money. I tend to write tests to most backend code and I want to add `cypress` to the frontend.
