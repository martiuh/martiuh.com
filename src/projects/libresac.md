### **What I learned**

- To write a plain HTML site (every change I did to a shared element I had to modify on each page).
- To use PHP (most of it forgot it) and the power of `includes`.
- To use skeleton.css, I chose it over bootstrap because I like that it's really small.
- Some css basics like transitions, image handling and more stuff.
- A few years ago I moved it into Gatsby due to much PHP errors (I'm not good managing a PHP server)

### **What it is?**

It's a website for a friend's NGO in Monterrey city, I did it for free and as a learning project, I know it has it's flaws but I think it's a good project.
