### **What I learned**

- The ins and outs of a static site generator.
- Better chunk handling
- How to publish and manage an npm package
- How some of Gatsby works, since I digged a lot into the code to see how they fixed things (like how they generate an import file from the `pages` directory)
- To create router based on the components within itself, since I had to know where were dynamic files.
- To hanlde webpack configuration a little bit better.
- To write documentation.

### **What it is?**

It's a static site generator that let's you use dynamic urls (was not restrictive as Gatsbys dynamic routing) but when I was finishing it I saw that `react-static` API changes allowed me to do the same things I wanted, so I dropped my project and started using `react-static` instead.`
