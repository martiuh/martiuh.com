### **What I learned**

- To read a webpack.config since I had to manage my own.
- Server Side Rendering with React and a lot about express in general.
- How to use loopback 3 and some of the customizations.
- Things about handling a REST API.
- The pain of database migrations and how careful you should be with it.
- I trimmed the app as much as I could because I wanted to be fast, removed a lot of unused dependencies and switched to lighter ones when needed.
- Code Splitting and a little on how webpack chunks work.
- Image storing and optimizations with loopback.
- `React Suspense` back then was even more experimental.
- Testing the app with throttling to see what was blocking a good first paint.
- SEO and using `react-helmet`.
- Redux (with SSR) and handling async code.
- Dashboard creation.
- To better calculate my time/money ratio since it took me more than a year and I rewrote it three times.
- To try to find a team since that was a really big project for a single developer

### **What it is?**

It's a website for a valve factory in my hometown, Guadalajara, the requirements of the client were a website were they can control its web catalog and they wanted it to be fast. I started creating my own SSR implementation back then there weren't a lot libraries to handle SSR (or I didn't like the existing ones)
